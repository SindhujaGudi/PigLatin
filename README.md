# PigLatin

Write a program that translates a text to Fake Latin and back. 
English is translated to Fake Latin by taking the first letter of every word, moving it to the end of the word and adding ‘ay’ to each word.

As an example, if your program reads from the keyboard the string “The quick brown fox” then it should print on the screen the following text: “Hetay uickqay rownbay oxfay”.

You should also implement the reverse of this, reading "Iay ikelay rogrammingpay" should print on the screen "I like programming".
